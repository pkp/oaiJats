About
-----
This plugin exposes JATS XML via the OAI-PMH interface.
Note that it DOES NOT generate JATS XML itself -- it assumes that this will
already be available. You can use a tool like Open Typesetting Stack
(https://pkp.sfu.ca/open-typesetting-stack/) to generate the JATS XML.

Once this plugin is enabled, it will look for JATS XML both in the Galleys
(for published content) and Production Ready (for unpublished content) areas.

It performs limited transformations of these static XML documents to augment
certain areas, such as DOIs, permissions, titles, and abstracts, to help keep
served data consistent with metadata in OJS. However, it is recommended that
editorial practices ensure that the two data sets remain consistent rather than
relying on the transformation built into this plugin.
